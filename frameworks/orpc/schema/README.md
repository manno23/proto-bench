# oRPC Schema

oRPC (https://github.com/unnoq/orpc) is being investigated for its object capability security properties.

## TODO

- Investigate oRPC schema definition format
- Determine if oRPC uses Protocol Buffers, JSON Schema, or custom IDL
- Implement benchmark service schema in oRPC format
- Document object capability security features

## Notes

oRPC focuses on:
- Object capability security model
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Transport code generation

This directory will contain the oRPC-specific schema definitions once the framework investigation is complete.
